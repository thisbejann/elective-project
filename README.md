# Budg.It - Your income and expense tracker!

A web application to trace all your financial statements

## Technologies
This project is created using:
* React.js
* Tailwind CSS
* Daisy UI
* Syncfusion
* Firebase

## General Info

This is a personal/school project that me and my groupmates worked together with. We thought of this idea because as early adults, we have come to the part of our life that we have to be financially literate. So we built this project in order for us to keep track of our daily expenses and income.

This project also served as a lesson for me to learn React.js as I want this to be my front-end framework as I go to my professional career in web development.

## Setup

To run this project, clone the github repository and then install npm locally:

```
$ cd {project folder}
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
